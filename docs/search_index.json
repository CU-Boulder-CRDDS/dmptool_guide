These plans are increasingly required by funding agencies as a part of grant applications, but remain a relatively novel form of documentation with which researchers are sometimes unfamiliar. DMPTool is a platform that provides structured assistance to researchers that would like to craft a data management plan. It allows researchers to view sample plans that have been completed in the past, and develop new data management plans using DMP templates that correspond to the requirements of the major funding agencies. It also allows for easy collaboration among project teams, including among project teams that are dispersed across multiple institutions. Many academic and research institutions use customized versions of DMPTool, including CU Boulder. Below, in Section 2, we provide a brief guide to using DMPTool for CU researchers; Section 3 provides suggestions on further reading.

Here, you can begin a new DMP; resume working on a saved DMP (in-progress DMPs will show up under the My Dashboard sign if they exist); or view sample DMPs created by other CU researchers (under the banner that reads University of Colorado Boulder Plans) Figure 2.3: Your Personal DMPTool Dashboard 2.2 Create a new plan To initiate a new plan, click the blue Create plan button (see figure 2.3), which will bring you to an interface like the one below: Figure 2.4: Initiate a new plan Here, you can provide relevant details about your project, such as its name, the funding organization, and the DMP template you would like to use. In this example, we’ve named our project “Demonstration”, and have selected the NSF and the generic NSF DMP template under the funder and template headings. Once you’ve filled out this information, go ahead and click the blue Create plan button, as in Figure 2.4. 2.3 Customize, Write, and Compile the Data Management Plan "],["additional-resources.html", "3 Additional Resources", " 3 Additional Resources "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
